# TODO: Update Navbar Component

- [x] Update src/component/Navbar.jsx to include proper navigation links (e.g., Home, Menu, About, Contact) with responsive design and coffee shop branding.
- [x] Ensure the navbar overlays the hero section as per user requirements (fixed positioning with z-20).
- [x] Test the navbar by running the development server and verifying appearance and responsiveness.
